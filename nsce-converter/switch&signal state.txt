9,-9 = dark 
1 = RED (STOP)for trains moving MP increasing (e.g. the signal is facing train moving in the MP increasing direction, so trains moving MP increasing must STOP (technically it is facing MP decreasing) 
2 = YELLOW (APPROACH) for trains moving MP increasing 
3 = FLASHING_YELLOW (ADVANCE-APPROACH) for trains moving MP increasing 
4 = GREEN (CLEAR) for trains moving MP increasing 
-1 = RED (STOP)for trains moving MP decreasing (e.g. the signal is facing trains moving in the MP decreasing direction (technically it is facing MP increasing) -2 = YELLOW (APPROACH) for trains moving MP decreasing -3 = FLASHING_YELLOW (ADVANCE-APPROACH) for trains moving MP decreasing
